# üõ°Ô∏è Ensuring Business Continuity: A Centralized Backup & Disaster Recovery Strategy

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A resilient, scalable, and automated solution designed to safeguard on-premise VMs and critical AWS resources, ensuring minimal downtime and zero data loss.

This repository contains the complete architecture, implementation scripts, and operational procedures for a centralized backup and disaster recovery (DR) strategy. It was architected to provide high availability and data integrity across a hybrid cloud environment.

---

## üéØ Project Objective

To architect and implement a unified disaster recovery framework that minimizes **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)** and **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**. This is achieved through robust automation, comprehensive monitoring, and clearly documented procedures to counter infrastructure failures, human error, or cyber threats.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Hybrid Environment Support**: Manages backups for both on-premise virtual machines (e.g., VMware, Hyper-V) and AWS cloud resources (EBS Snapshots).
*   **Automated Backup Lifecycle**: Robust scripts (Python/Bash) for scheduling, executing, and verifying backups with configurable retention policies.
*   **Centralized Management**: A single control plane for initiating and monitoring all backup and recovery operations.
*   **Continuous Health Monitoring**: Real-time observability into backup job status, system health, and storage utilization using Prometheus.
*   **Intelligent Alerting**: Proactive notifications for backup failures, RPO violations, or system anomalies via Alertmanager (to Slack, Email, etc.).
*   **Rich Visualization**: Interactive Grafana dashboards provide a clear view of backup history, duration, data size, and DR readiness.
*   **Documented DR Playbooks**: Step-by-step runbooks for various failure scenarios, ensuring a predictable and rapid recovery.
*   **Immutable & Secure**: Implements best practices like encrypted backups and can integrate with immutable storage targets (like S3 Object Lock) to protect against ransomware.

## üß≠ Guiding Principles

This solution was designed with the following Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) and DevOps best practices in mind:

*   üîê **Security First**: Use of least-privilege IAM roles, encrypted data transfer and at-rest storage, and secure credentials management.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **Automation Over Manual Toil**: If a task is repeatable, it is scripted. This reduces human error and ensures consistency.
*   üìà **Designed for Scalability**: The architecture can grow from a handful of VMs to hundreds of assets without a major redesign.
*   ‚úÖ **Testability is Key**: The system is built to be regularly tested. A DR plan that isn't tested is not a plan‚Äîit's a theory.
*   üìä **Observability is Not an Afterthought**: Deep monitoring and alerting are integrated into the core of the solution.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The architecture is designed for resilience and clarity. A central backup orchestrator manages the entire process, collecting data from on-premise and cloud sources, storing it securely, and exposing metrics for monitoring.

```

**[TODO: Write a paragraph explaining the data flow. For example:** *"The backup orchestrator, running on a dedicated Linux server, executes scripts based on a cron schedule. These scripts connect to the on-premise vSphere API to snapshot VMs and use the AWS CLI to create EBS snapshots in the cloud. Backup data and metadata are stored in the central repository, while operational metrics (e.g., job duration, success/failure) are exposed via a Prometheus exporter. Grafana queries Prometheus to display dashboards, and Alertmanager fires alerts on predefined rules."* **]**

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Automation & Scripting**: Python (Boto3), Bash
*   **Cloud Provider**: AWS (EC2, EBS, S3, IAM)
*   **On-Premise Virtualization**: `[TODO: Specify vSphere, Hyper-V, or other]`
*   **Monitoring**: Prometheus
*   **Visualization & Alerting**: Grafana, Alertmanager

*   **Notifications**: Slack, PagerDuty, Email

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the backup and recovery environment.

### Prerequisites

*   `[TODO: List all required tools and access levels. Be specific with versions.]`
*   **Example:**
    *   Python 3.8+ with `boto3` and `requests`
    *   AWS CLI v2, configured with an IAM user/role with appropriate permissions.
    *   SSH key-based access to on-premise hypervisor or management server.
    *   Docker & Docker Compose (for running the monitoring stack).
    *   `rsync` and `jq` installed.

### Installation & Configuration

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[your-repository-name].git
    cd [your-repository-name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    `[TODO: Provide command to install Python/other dependencies]`
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure the environment:**
    `[TODO: Explain how to configure your scripts. This is a critical step.]`
    *   Rename `config.env.example` to `config.env`.
    *   Update `.env` with your AWS credentials, on-premise endpoints, and S3 bucket names.
    *   Define your backup targets in `targets.yml`.

4.  **Launch the Monitoring Stack:**
    ```sh
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
    This will start the Prometheus and Grafana containers.
    *   **Prometheus:** `http://<your-server-ip>:9090`
    *   **Grafana:** `http://<your-server-ip>:3000` (Default user/pass: admin/admin)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### Running a Manual Backup

To trigger an on-demand backup for a specific target:
`[TODO: Provide the exact command and an example]`
```sh
python run_backup.py --target <target_name_from_targets.yml>
```

### Performing a Restore

The restoration process is documented in detail in the runbooks. At a high level:
`[TODO: Provide the high-level steps and a sample command]`
1.  Identify the required backup/snapshot ID from logs or the Grafana dashboard.
2.  Run the restoration script with the identified ID and destination:
    ```sh
    python run_restore.py --snapshot-id <aws-snapshot-id> --destination-instance <aws-instance-id>
    ```

---

## üìä Monitoring & Alerting

*   **Grafana Dashboards**: Pre-built dashboards located in the `/dashboards` directory can be imported into Grafana to visualize:
    *   Backup Job Status (Success, Failed, In-Progress)
    *   RPO Compliance Tracker
    *   Backup Duration & Data Size Trends
    *   Storage Capacity
    `[TODO: Add a screenshot of your main Grafana dashboard here. This is very impactful!]`

*   **Prometheus Alerts**: Alerting rules are defined in `prometheus/alert.rules.yml`. Key alerts include:
    *   `BackupJobFailed`: Triggers if a backup job fails.
    *   `RPOViolated`: Triggers if the time since the last successful backup exceeds the defined RPO.
    *   `BackupStorageCapacityHigh`: Fires when the backup repository disk usage is > 85%.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Disaster Recovery Procedures (RTO/RPO)

Our recovery objectives are tiered to align with business criticality.

| Tier | RTO (Recovery Time Objective) | RPO (Recovery Point Objective) | Example Workloads                        |
| :--- | :---------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| **1**| `[TODO: e.g., < 1 hour]`      | `[TODO: e.g., < 15 minutes]`   | `[TODO: e.g., Critical Databases, Auth Services]` |
| **2**| `[TODO: e.g., < 4 hours]`     | `[TODO: e.g., < 12 hours]`     | `[TODO: e.g., Internal Apps, Web Servers]` |
| **3**| `[TODO: e.g., < 24 hours]`    | `[TODO: e.g., < 24 hours]`     | `[TODO: e.g., Dev/Test Environments, Archives]`  |

Detailed, step-by-step DR plans for various scenarios are located in the `/runbooks` directory.
*   `[DR Plan: On-Premise Host Failure](./runbooks/on_prem_host_failure.md)`
*   `[DR Plan: AWS Region Unavailability](./runbooks/aws_region_failure.md)`
*   `[DR Plan: Ransomware Attack / Data Corruption](./runbooks/data_corruption_recovery.md)`

---

## üß™ Testing & Validation

A disaster recovery plan is only reliable if it is regularly tested. Our validation strategy includes:

*   **Automated Restore Tests**: Weekly, automated jobs that restore a non-critical VM or a snapshot to a temporary location and run a basic health check.
*   **Quarterly DR Drills**: Simulated, full-scale outage drills to test the procedures, tools, and team response.
*   **Performance Tracking**: We measure the **Actual Recovery Time (ART)** during tests and use it to refine our RTOs and procedures.
